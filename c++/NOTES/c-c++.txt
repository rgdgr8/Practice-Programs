scanf is exactly same as cin---------EXCEPT for char!!!!!!!

1) scanf always reads from next line just like cin
2) scanf only reads till whitespaces or \n just like cin

#### Only difference is that cin reads char also from next line while
#### scanf reads from same line!!!!!
****** To overcome this we may use scanf twice or scanf(" %c",&c); --NOTICE THE SPACE--

****** Even when inputting string like scanf(" %[^\n]%*c",s) we need to use space, otherwise 
things will not work, since this pattern reads string char by char**********************
